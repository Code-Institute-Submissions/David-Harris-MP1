This is my first milestone project. The aim of this project is to build at least a three-page static frontend mobile-first responsive website. I will be demonstrating the skills I have learnt in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap while considering design concepts and best practices of UX friendly design.
 
## UX

I've built this website for the purpose of education and sharing of free information. This is to allow users a place to access route information for beach walks in the south coast of England.

- As a user I want a location to reference for information for beach walks.
- As the business & website owner I want a location where I can share built up knowledge and grow a community of likeminded people to share information, build and grow larger to eventually organise group walks & activities.

I have uploaded both the raw version of the wirefame that was created using the software "Balsamiq Wireframes" and a readable PDF version of the wireframes. These show the planning and origonal design before I started to code the website.

The documents can be via the downloaded via the links below:

## Features

This is my first ever official front-end development project, so I didn't want to go overboard on technical design. I am still very early in my learning process and am putting this project together to go from a blank canvas to a completed front-end static website accessible via GitHub Pages.

List of planned and included features:
 - Four separate web pages all linked together via hyperlinks.
 - Visible maps and route data for walks that is clear to read and understand for users.
 - Ability for users to submit their own suggested walks for review and submission to the website.
 
## Technologies Used

- [HTML] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
    - This project uses HTML for the basic structure of the data.

- [CSS] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets
    - This project uses CSS for applying custom styles to the HTML.

- [Bootstrap] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework
    - This project uses the Bootstrap framework to enable some handy tools to quickly build up and assist with a mobile first designed website.
