# MP1

This is my first milestone project. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the skills that I have learnt in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and UX design. I will also be using some Bootstrap framework.
 
## UX

I've built this website for the purpose of education and sharing of free information. This is to allow users a place to access route information for beach walks in the south coast of England.

- As a user I want a location to reference for information for beach walks.
- As the business & website owner I want a location where I can share built up knowledge and grow a community of likeminded people to share information, build and grow larger to eventually organise group walks & activities.

I have uploaded the PDF version of my wireframes for the website design. The document can be via the downloaded link here: [Wireframe PDF Format](https://github.com/davidhuk/David-Harris-MP1/raw/master/assets/Wireframes/david-harris-milestone-project-1-wireframes.pdf)
## Features

This is my first ever official front-end development project, so I didn't want to go overboard on technical design. I am still very early in my learning process and am putting this project together to go from a blank canvas to a completed front-end static website accessible via GitHub Pages.

List of planned and included features:
 - 4 Separate websites all linked together via hyperlinks
 - Visible maps and route data for walks that is clear to read and understand for users.
 - Ability for users to submit their own suggested walks for review and submission to the website.
 
## Technologies Used

- [HTML] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
    - This project uses HTML for the basic structure of the data.

- [CSS] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets
    - This project uses CSS for applying custom styles to the HTML.

- [Bootstrap] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework
    - This project uses the Bootstrap framework to enable some handy tools to quickly build up and assist with a mobile first designed website.
